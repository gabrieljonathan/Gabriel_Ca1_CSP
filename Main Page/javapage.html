                <h2> What is Java?</h2>
                <p> Java is a type of object-oriented programming language,
                    widely used for developing websites and applications. 
                    Its intention is to allow developers to write the program 
                    only once and run it through any device.
                </p>
                <p> JSP is the acronym for Java Server Pages, it is an open 
                    specification scripting language with the primary objective 
                    of generating dynamic content for Internet pages.
                </p>
                <h2> How does it work?</h2>
                <p>In web pages JSP (Java Server Pages) is used, instead of 
                    using HTML to develop static and featureless web pages, JSP 
                    is implemented to create dynamism. It is possible to write HTML, 
                    with embedded JSP code. As HTML is a static language, JSP will 
                    be responsible for creating dynamism.  The JSP needs server 
                    to work for being a language Server-side script, the user can 
                    not see the JSP coding, because this is converted directly by 
                    the server, being presented to the user only HTML coding.
                </p>
                <p>A JSP page has jps extension and consists of a page with HTML coding 
                    and Java coding, inserted between the tag's <% and %>, called scriptlets 
                    and working as follows: the server receives a request for a JSP page, 
                    interprets this page generating the HTML coding and returns to the client 
                    the result of your request
                </p>
                <h2>Example</h2>
                <p>Below you can see an implementation of Java in HTML, by clicking on the 
                    button you can see some information about me. This is only possible thanks 
                    to the dynamism that Java offers, using only HTML this wouldn't be possible. 
                    Let's test it?</p>
                <p id= "demo"></p>
                <footer></footer>          
                <button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML ="<br> Name: Gabriel Jonathan Martins de Sousa <br> Student Number: 2020362 "'>Click to know more!</button>
                
                <p>In the following video as well as in the topics covered previously, 
                    you will see a different explanation with examples and Java applications, 
                    this will help you better understand everything that was covered previously.
