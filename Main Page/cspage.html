                <h2> What is CSS?</h2>
                <p> CSS is the acronym used for Cascading Style Sheet,
                    it is a language of styles used to stylize elements of 
                    a page developed with a markup language, like HTML.
                    What it does is separate the structural written part 
                    from the visual part, in other words, the graphic designer of the page.
                </p>
                <p> 
                </p>
                <h2> How does it work?</h2>
                <p>Css works through a syntax of codes that have their
                 own rules and work on the visual presentation. When a 
                 developer applies this CSS code to the structure of a 
                 page, it is stored together with other information on 
                 that page. This can include text content, animations, 
                 videos and whatever else has been inserted.</p>
                <p>So when a user accesses a website, the browser organizes
                 all this data and displays the stylized visual elements on 
                 the screen. This is the combination of languages that happens 
                 on most websites so that users feel more attracted to continue 
                 accessing the page.</p>
                
                <h2>Example</h2>
                <p>CSS uses a simple syntax with a set of rules that govern it, 
                    HTML was never intended to use style elements, only page markup. 
                    It was created to describe just the content. For example: < p>This is a paragraph.< /p>.
                <p>The structure of CSS syntax is pretty simple. You have a selector and
                    a declaration block. You select an element and then declare what you want to do with it. 
                    In the video below you can understand a bit more about it and see some practical examples mentioned.
