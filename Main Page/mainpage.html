                <h2> What is HTML?</h2>
                <p> HTML is the acronym used for Hyper Text Markup Language,
                    or better saying, hypertext markup language. It allows users
                    to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings and
                    links for web pages or applications.
                </p>
                <p> HTML is not a programming
                    language, i.e. it cannot be used to create dynamic functionalities.
                    However, HTML does enable the organisation and formatting of 
                    documents, similar to Microsoft Word.
                </p>
                <h2> How does it work?</h2>
                <p>Whenever we enter a web page the resulting interface, in most cases 
                    is obtained through layers with different functions. Each layer is 
                    represented by a specific language.</p>
                <p>The most common are the following three: HTML is the layer that presents 
                    the content, it is responsible for displaying the content giving it meaning. 
                    CSS is the layer that gives form to the elements of the HTML, selects an 
                    element of the HTML to stylize it and presents it as a new form in the browser. 
                    And finally the JavaScript layer that adds dynamic behaviour, for example when 
                    filling out a form we miss the e-mail and the system warns us.</p>
                <p>Most major websites use some kind of server-side technology to dynamically 
                    display different data as needed. For example, imagine how many products are 
                    available on Amazon and imagine how many posts have been written on Facebook? 
                    Displaying all of that using completely different static pages would be completely 
                    inefficient, so instead these sites display static templates (built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), 
                    and then dynamically update the data displayed within those templates as needed </p>
                <p>HTML documents are files with the extensions .html or .htm. They can be viewed 
                    with any browser (such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox). The browser 
                    reads the file and renders its contents for users to view.</p>
                <p>Common websites usually have several HTML pages. For example: homepages, pages 
                    explaining the purpose of the site, and contact pages would all have different HTML documents.</p>
                <p>Each HTML page consists of a series of tags, which can be thought of as the 
                    building blocks of the pages. They create a hierarchy that structures the content 
                    between sections, paragraphs, headings and other content blocks.</p>
                <p>Most HTML elements use opening and closing syntax such as < tag> and < /tag>. 
                    Overall HTML is a relatively easy markup language to learn even for beginners</p>
                <h2>Client-side</h2>
                <p>The client-side of an application is where it is processed, in the case of the web, 
                    it executes in the client's browser which is responsible for interacting with the HTTP Server. 
                    Among the client-side technologies we have HTML that is executed in the browser, CSS is another 
                    client technology that is used to format HTML pages, there is also javascript that allows you to 
                    develop or extend the power of the client side.</p>
                <h2>Server-side</h2>    
                <p>Server-side, in turn, is the term that represents the set of technologies in which the processes 
                    are interpreted/processed directly on the server, returning the client-side coding as a result. 
                    When a network user accesses a web page, a request is sent to the server through the http protocol 
                    so that the server sends a response. The Server besides running the applications, the server side 
                    is also a repository of static pages, which will be sent to the client when requested. Assuming there is a JSP page, 
                    it will be processed by the server and forwarded a response to the Browser.</p>
                <h2>Example</h2>
                <p>The video below has been inserted through HTML, via the < iframe> command. 
                    This is an example of the many features of HTML and also the inserted video can 
                    help you understand more about it. </p>
